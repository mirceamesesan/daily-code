# Daily explorations
While experimenting with Pyton and other fresh material found on the internet.

## Day 1
Exploring with uv ```brew install uv``` a python package manager that can replace PIP with its speed, as it was built in RUST.

Useful reads and documentation:
- https://astral.sh/blog/uv
- https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
- https://youtu.be/qh98qOND6MI?si=FzJGVmxhdYc3q8ss

When moving to a different machine, you can install dependencies with ```uv run``` and it will install all the dependencies from the ```pyproject.toml``` file and also will create a virtual environment for you.


## Day 2
Creating a fast-api with uvicorn and testing in Postman.


## Day 3
Accesing the api Endpoints with requests in Python.


## Day 4
